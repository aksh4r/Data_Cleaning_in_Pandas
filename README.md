# Data Cleaning in Pandas - Practical Guide and Insights

This repository provides a comprehensive guide on data cleaning techniques using Python's Pandas library. The project demonstrates practical approaches to handle messy data, showcasing solutions for missing values, duplicates, outliers, and inconsistent formats. The aim is to enable users to transform raw data into a clean, analysis-ready format for actionable insights.

## Key Aspects of the Project

### 1. Missing Value Treatment
- Identifying missing data across columns and rows.
- Employing strategies like imputation, forward-filling, and backward-filling to handle null values.

### 2. Data Type Conversion
- Transforming column data types (e.g., integers, floats, strings, dates) to ensure consistency and compatibility.

### 3. Duplicate Removal
- Detecting and eliminating duplicate rows to maintain data integrity and reduce redundancy.

### 4. Outlier Handling
- Identifying outliers using statistical methods (e.g., IQR, z-scores) and deciding whether to cap, remove, or retain them.

### 5. String Manipulation
- Standardizing text data by stripping whitespace, correcting case sensitivity, and resolving inconsistencies.

### 6. Date/Time Data Cleaning
- Parsing and formatting date/time columns for temporal analyses and trend evaluation.
